                Although the game elements change from year to year, the competition always contains three rounds: autonomous, TeleOp, and endgame. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                During the autonomous period, robots run on a preprogrammed system that can have no human input for 30 seconds. 
                This period usually has a high point potential. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                After the autonomous period is over, the TeleOp (teleoperation, the control of a device or machine remotely) round begins. 
                During this period human players are allowed to control the robot's actions. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Scoring during the autonomous period and TeleOp period works slightly differently so be sure to understand the teas's goals during each section. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The final round of the competition is the endgame, which is also TeleOp. 
                This round allows for additional scoring and is also a crucial part of the game. 
                Usually, the robot can score points in the same ways as the TeleOp round. 
                However, during the endgame, there are additional scoring opportunities. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Each round we are matched with an alliance team with whom we will work together to complete game objectives.
